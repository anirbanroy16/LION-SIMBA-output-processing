# LION-SIMBA-output-processing
This was my first step towards entering the battery domain in 2020, but lazy ass yours truly is uploading this only today!

This repository contains processing scripts to evaluate the spatio-temporal evolution of battery variables, such as temperature, electrolyte concentration etc from the LION-SIMBA P2D battery multiphysics model. There is also a script (element_specific.m) to pull out strip-specific information from electrode, electrolyte and separator.

I'm including a few slides and figures that detail the explanation of the spatio-temporal evolutions. The exact scripts might not be in this repository (these files were retrieved from my old computer) but can at least give a flavour. Also included is a sample data dump from an isothermal simulation in a .mat file.
